        Python
    </h1>

    <p>

        Python is a <b>general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language.</b> It supports Object
        Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of
        high-level data structures.

        Python is easy to learn yet <strong>powerful and versatile scripting language,</strong> which makes it attractive for Application
        Development.

        Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid
        application development.

        Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or
        procedural programming styles.

        Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming.<i> That is why it is known as
        multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.</i>

        We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to
        assign an integer value in an integer variable.

       <mark> Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python
        development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.</mark>
