    <p>

        C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b> starting in <strong>1979 at Bell Labs.</strong> C++
        runs on a variety of platforms, such as <i>Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.</i> This C++ tutorial
        adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software
        engineers.

       <h2> Why to Learn C++ ? </h2>

       <ul>
       <li> C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some
        of the key advantages of learning C++:</li>

        <li> C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in
        terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.</li>

        <li> C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level
        implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic
        type identification.</li>

        <li> C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a
        great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your
        work.</li>

        <li> C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your
        area of interest of software development.</li>

        <li> C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage
        classes, variable types their scopes etc.</li>

        <li> There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming
        language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.</li>
