      <li>  A <b>Digital computer</b> can be considered as a digital system that performs various computational tasks.</li>

<li>The first electronic digital computer was developed in the late <mark>1940s </mark>and was used primarily for numerical computations.</li>

<li>By convention, the digital computers use the binary number system, which has two digits: 0 and 1. A binary digit is called a bit.</li>

<li>A computer system is subdivided into two functional entities: <i>Hardware and Software.</i><br>

<li>The hardware consists of all the electronic components and electromechanical devices that comprise the physical entity of the device.</li>

<li><u>The software of the computer consists of the instructions and data that the computer manipulates to perform various data-processing tasks</u>
