        ENIAC
    </h1>

    <p>
        ENIAC or <mark>Electronic Numerical Integrator</mark> and Computer was the first programmable, <a href="electronic.html" target="_blank">electronic</a>,
        general-purpose <a href="digital.html" target="_blank" >digital computer.</a> It was Turing-complete, and able to solve "a large class of numerical
        problems" through reprogramming.

        Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the <b>United States Army's
        Ballistic Research Laboratory</b> (which later became a part of the <u>Army Research Laboratory</u>), its first
        program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.

        ENIAC was completed in <strong>1945</strong> and first put to work for practical purposes on <mark> 10, 1945.</mark>
