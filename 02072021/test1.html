        Global Warming

    <p>
        Global warming is not caused by one sole reason that can be curbed. There are multifarious factors that cause
        global warming most of which are a part of an individual’s daily existence.</p>

    <p> Burning of fuels for cooking, in
        vehicles, and for other conventional uses, a large amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane
        amongst many others is produced which accelerates global warming.</p>

    <p> Rampant deforestation also results in global
        warming as lesser green cover results in an increased presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which is a
        greenhouse gas.
