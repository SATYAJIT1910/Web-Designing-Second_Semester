        Environmental Pollution

    <p>
        Pollution is a word that even children already know. It has become so routine that virtually everyone
        acknowledges that pollution is continuously rising. The term ‘pollution’ means any unwanted foreign substance
        manifested in something. When we talk about Earth’s pollution, we are referring to the contamination that is
        happening through toxic elements from natural resources.
